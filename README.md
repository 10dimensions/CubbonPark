# Project Lindenmayer

A standalone mobile application envisioned as a single platform to provide navigational, informational, 
and immersive experiences to travellers interested in central and national parks all around the world. 

## Motives
Unlike Art Galleries and Museum Exhibits, information guides are not widely prevalent and extensive when it comes to zoological, 
city central and national parks. And the vast distances which characterize the outdoor parks also makes signage boards less convenient. 
The advent of Geo-Spatial computing technology in recent years makes it possible to provide a seamless experience for travellers all around
the world.
For the initial prototype, the central park of Bengaluru City, India namely “Cubbon Park” officially known as “Sri Chamarajendra Park”, 
was chosen as the reference. With a coverage area of over 1.2 sq. km, the park serves as a perfect proving ground. It is also home to 
68 genera and 96 species of plants/trees. Detailed map of flowering plants with annual calendar is provided by the Park Authorities, 
based on which a few species (Bamboo, Beech and African Tulip) were chosen for the prototype.

## Technology Stack
- Unity (rendering + application)
– Mapbox (geospatial)
– 8thWall XR (augmented reality)
- TreeIt (vegetation)

## Next Iteration ...
- Integration of native AR libraries (or) Vuforia
- Asset Creation of remaining Trees and Sculptures
- Integration of dataset embedded within the map, using Mapbox Scriptable Node System
